Title: List Data Sources for Southern Ocean Ecosystem Research
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(
    person("Michael D.", "Sumner", , "michael.sumner@aad.gov.au", role = c("aut", "cre")))
Description: Obtains lists of files of remote sensing collections for Southern Ocean surface 
 properties. Commonly used data sources of sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration, and 
 altimetry products such as sea surface height and sea surface currents are cached in object storage
 on the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre facility. Functions to retreive these object storage
 catalogues are provided. In future releases this package will include helpers to identify particular
 data collections and target specific dates for earth observation data to be read and manipulated.
