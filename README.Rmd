The goal of sooty is to provide data of interest to Southern Ocean research. 

At the moment we only return lists of files available in object storage, but future versions will provide direct access to the data in these files with helper functions
defined here. 

To see what files we have in object storage, use 

```{r sooty}
library(sooty)
(files <- tibble::as_tibble(sooty_files()))
```

These are all directly useable source identifiers that a GDAL-enabled package can read. 

In time we will provide helpers to pick specific data sets and open data for a given date. 

For now we only have manual handling, such as

```{r terra}
library(terra)
file <- files$source[which.max(files$date) ]
print(file)

rast(file)
```
