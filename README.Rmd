The goal of sooty is to read data of interest to Southern Ocean research. 



At the moment we only return lists of files available in object storage, but future versions will provide direct access to the data in these files with helper functions
defined here. 

To see what files we have in object storage, use 

```{r sooty}
library(sooty)
(files <- tibble::as_tibble(sooty_files()))
```

These are all directly useable source identifiers that a GDAL-enabled package can read. 

In time we will provide helpers to pick specific data sets and open data for a given date. 

For now we only have manual handling, such as

```{r terra}
library(terra)
file <- files$source[which.max(files$date) ]
print(file)

Sys.setenv(AWS_S3_ENDPOINT="projects.pawsey.org.au", 
           AWS_NO_SIGN_REQUEST="YES",
           GDAL_DISABLE_READDIR_ON_OPEN = "EMPTY_DIR")
rast(file)
```


There are data sets like the 25km resolution south polar stereographic sea ice concentration, available via `readnsidc25kmS()`: 

```{r south}
library(sooty)
readnsidc25kmS()
```

You can immediately see what range of dates is available by setting `latest = FALSE`: 


```{r oldest}
readnsidc25kmS(latest = FALSE)
```

And, explore exactly what source files are available with the full table: 

```{r files}
files <- nsidc25kmSfiles()

range(files$date)
range(diff(files$date))  ## there are some gaps, it's every two days to start and some are missing

diff(range(files$date))  ## the number of potential data days

nrow(files)  ## the actual number of data days
```

This is a very experimental begin at replacing [raadtools](https://github.com/AustralianAntarcticDivision/raadtools) with a package anyone can use. 

Apart from north and south 25km sea ice we also have higher resolution sea ice data for the southern hemisphere. 

```{r amsr}
readamsr()

```

### Global SST 0.25 degree from 1982-current

```{r sst}
readoisst()
```



### Note for MacOS users (sadly)

On MacOS the best GDAL we can get is 3.5.3 which is sadly too old for some of these NetCDF files (these can be worked around but I don't want to do that here). 

At your own risk, we've had success installing GDAL latest. 

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" && brew install gdal --HEAD
```


We haven't yet figured out what is the minimum version needed for this package to work well with all the datasets, or how to get a particular commit/tag/version (WIP).
